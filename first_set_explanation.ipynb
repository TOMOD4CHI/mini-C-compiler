    "# FIRST Set Computation Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The `FIRST` set of a nonterminal in a context-free grammar contains all terminals that can appear as the first symbol of a string derived from that nonterminal. This is crucial for top-down parsing to predict which production to apply based on the input token.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "The provided `first` method computes `FIRST` sets for all nonterminals in the grammar, handling recursion, nullable nonterminals, and terminal accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Creates a dictionary `first_sets` with empty sets for each nonterminal to store their `FIRST` sets.\n",
    "- **Iterative Convergence**: Uses a `while` loop with a `changed` flag to repeatedly process productions until no new terminals are added, avoiding infinite recursion.\n",
    "- **Helper Function (`_first_of_sequence`)**: Computes the `FIRST` set for a production sequence:\n",
    "  - For terminals, adds them directly and stops.\n",
    "  - For nonterminals, adds their `FIRST` set and continues to the next symbol if the nonterminal is nullable (in `null()`).\n",
    "  - Stops if a non-nullable symbol is encountered.\n",
    "- **Nullable Handling**: Checks for nullable nonterminals (those with empty productions) to include terminals from subsequent symbols in a production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "1. Initialize `first_sets` with empty sets for all nonterminals.\n",
    "2. Iterate until no changes occur:\n",
    "   - For each nonterminal, process its productions.\n",
    "   - Use `_first_of_sequence` to compute terminals for each production.\n",
    "   - Update `first_sets[nt]` with new terminals, setting `changed` if new terminals are added.\n",
    "3. Return `first_sets` with all computed `FIRST` sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "- Instantiate `Grammar` with your productions and axiom.\n",
    "- Create a `Parser` instance and call `parser.first()` to get `FIRST` sets.\n",
    "- Example output for a nonterminal like `expression` includes terminals like `\"NUMBER\"`, `\"IDENTIFIER\"`, `\"(\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Handles complex grammars with nullable nonterminals (e.g., `function_declarations`, `statements`).\n",
    "- Assumes tokens are distinct; whitespace handling may need tokenizer adjustments.\n",
    "- Useful for building parsing tables in top-down parsers like LL(1)."
